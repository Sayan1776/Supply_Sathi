Hello, we are team Error 404, academically from Gargi Memorial Institute  of Technology in Kolkata.

After analyzing the problem, we developed SupplySathi which is a web-based platform designed to help streetfood vendors in India easily connect with trusted raw materials supplier.

Our goal is to solve problems like unpredictable pricing, inconsistent quality, and lack of supplier  trancparency. Vendors can use SupplySathi   to browse verified suppliers, compare prices openly and place easily.

User can login using the buttons of header and also can sign up using the buttons of hero section.


Whenever a vendor is our user, they can easily find suppliers by  clicking on “Find Supplier” button and by scrolling manually. There is a same process for viewing order history.
They can browse available products by scrolling. After clicking on “Order now” , they can see the details and of product even they can directly contact supplier through WhatsApp.  They can select quantity of products and delivery date by themselves. After placing order, they will be redirected to payment they can choose any one for payment.

Logout

Whenever a supplier is will login our webapp, they can add products by simply clicking “Add products”
By scrolling my product section, they can also edit by themselves. Simply they can edit stocks of product. They can see their  incoming orders. After accepting the order, a confirmation message will be send to vendor through whatsapp.

This  is our whole solution we did and yes! This is a mobile friendly website for users.

Thank You from our whole team.
